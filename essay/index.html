        <p class="col_m">It was 2011 when I got my first smartphone. A Samsung Galaxy S: the first model of a successful series of smartphones, still among the most popular today. I remember the fascination that a 14-year-old guy who was passionate about technology could have in front of that object. It felt like a miniature computer with unlimited potential. In less than a year I was hooked on the Android world, trying to figure out how to make the most of such a tool. After some months since I bought the phone, Google released a new version of Android: 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. Needless to say, I couldn't wait to get the update from the company so I could try all the new features and graphical innovations. I soon discovered that my phone was a variant of the more famous flagship model, called Samsung Galaxy S SCL. This device differed by a few components from its main model, such as type of screen, GPU, and memory. However, this was enough to make it not compatible with the updates that the flagship model received. Digging into Android tech-enthusiast forums I discovered that some independent developers created unofficial updates of Android for my phone: that was my first contact with modding communities. From that time I started to mod my device by downloading and installing (or <a class="hand_glossary" onmouseover="openToast('glossary_flashing', false, 'c0')" onmouseleave="closeToast()">flashing</a> to use a tech slang term) unofficial firmwares, skins and mods, together with a friend of mine with the same phone model as me. The period between 2010 and 2018 was really prolific for developers and users: the influence this community has on the smartphone market it’s tangible.</p>

        <p class="col_m">Parallel to that path, as an enthusiast, I felt the need to communicate the existence of this underworld, mostly the prerogative of Android nerds. I wanted to enter this community as an active member. So, after some experiments made the year before, in July 2013 my friend Davide and I opened a YouTube channel dedicated to Android modding. The goal was to raise awareness of the culture of modding in Italy, where at the time it was still not widespread. From 2012 to 2016 we made informative videos about the smartphone market, next to reviews and tutorials about modding. We got in touch with different developers, met and supported small independent projects that were trying to come up with an open and user-oriented idea of technology. One aspect that I became aware of only later is the political power of this community: modding is not just about solving technical issues but is a collective effort to elaborate an idea of technology that they intend to apply to society. Users and enthusiasts come together spontaneously to react to market trends that they see as not in line with their own thinking. The subversion of production systems into collective bottom-up logic makes modding a practice of activism. This opens up discussions about the role of the user within the phone market. If we frame these debates as a public discussion, what are the user's rights?</p>

        <p class="col_m">This paper stems from the need to frame Android modding within a broader movement of hacking practices and technological activism. Since there are not any books or bibliographic resources specifically about Android modding the information I retrieved is taken mainly from forum threads, YouTube videos and articles in tech magazines. The reconstruction of the birth and development of this community is mediated by what has been my approach and experience as a user and disseminator. I, therefore, invite people to see this text as an attempt at a partial reconstruction of a complex movement that includes tens of thousands of developers and as many threads on forums and videos.</p>

        According to the Cambridge dictionary, luxury is “something expensive that is pleasant to have but is not necessary”. <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToast('note_1_1', true, 'c1')"> 1 </sup> Luxury is a driving force because for many people it represents one of the keys to positioning themselves in a higher social class. In many areas, luxury manifests itself as experiential luxury, related to the design of goods. In technology, luxury can be seen as an overabundance of computing power and is conveyed through data and lists of specs. In this chapter, I intend to explore the concept of computational luxury understood as a feature that marked the early development of the smartphone market. In the decade 2007-2017, we witnessed a technological boost that conditioned the social, environmental and technological impact of this sector. The phone market was driven by a surplus of computing power that monopolized it. Communication has also been shaped around selling data, numbers, and the technical features of devices, fueling consumerist logic. But in order to grasp this logic, we must understand the cultural shift in the software and hardware we operate - from advanced office stationery in the 90s to a personal accessory of the second half of the 2000s. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, mobile devices were seen as business tools, which aimed to digitize some office functions (agenda, mail, calendar). PDAs (personal digital assistants) were an attempt to miniaturize computers, becoming the first mobile products to include personal information managing tools. The concept of these products is similar to the early computer user interfaces, which took full force from the imagery of the office to create a digital simile. The metaphor of the desk with files, folders, and recycle bin is carried over into the mobile world. It takes a business-oriented direction, becoming a status symbol among American managers.</p>

      <p class="col_m">On January 9, 2007, the first step of a big revolution happened: Steve Jobs presented the first iPhone at the MacWorld conference in San Francisco. With this announcement Apple changed the paradigm of these devices forever. Already previously with products such as Nokia 9210 Communicator (2001) or the world of Pocket PCs there was an attempt to expand this market in this direction. However, it’s only after Apple's conference that smartphones are consolidated in our daily lives. These objects from substitutes for physical office objects (calculator, notebook, landline phone) have become our photo and music archives as well as leisure and entertainment devices. The way smartphones are sold also changed: we moved from a business-oriented type of communication to a more intimate and mundane one. Ties and desks disappeared from ads and we started to see parents, children, living rooms, kitchens and everyday situations. But how to stand out in this new technological environment where products become more than just the sum of their operations and where the immediate utility of technology is obscured?</p>

      <p class="col_m">In the second decade of the 2000s, smartphone manufacturers spent their energies on miniaturizing smartphone components with the goal enhancing the performance. From then on, the computational luxury sets in. Each year the challenge is to be able to produce a device that outperforms both the competitors and their predecessors from the previous year. The advertising language is enriched with technical terminologies such as PPI, NIT for displays; mAh and Watt for battery life and charging speed; MegaPixel for cameras and GHz for processors. This approach has bent the market to the continuous search for data that can be sold to the public, incentivizing the consumerist aspect. This trend leads to an obsession with the practice of benchmarking. The goal is to stress test the device in order to retrieve a score that can be used to compare different phones. While reviews and hands-on videos spread across the web, versus.com becomes more and more popular. This website allows you to compare the technical specifications of different smartphones. Platforms like these contribute to shaping the debate in a purely technical realm. We can imagine that this tech direction is also a consequence of homogenization in terms of design <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToast('note_1_2', true, 'c1')"> 2 </sup>: if the device cannot stand out aesthetically, it must do so through its technical capabilities. Since the variety of shapes, screen types, and colors has become obsolete, branding strategies had to adapt.</p>

        <p class="col_m">In this period, manufacturers decided to release more and more phones into the market than the usual annual unveilings: hence, an overabundance of devices was created. Consumers had to face this clutter, being seduced to consider the computational aspect as crucial, no longer finding answers in product design. Also nomenclatures became more complex: we can notice the widespread use of terms like mini, plus, pro and ultra, which confuse the consumer. These categories, based on supposedly objective technical capabilities rather than aesthetic qualities, created a clear hierarchy. Slide-out keyboards, rotating cameras, and satin finishes are no longer criteria for producing and categorizing phones. The new policy of manufacturers is to produce the flagship model with the highest performance possible and saturate the market in the mid-range by distributing mini, ultra or max variants.<br><br>After the dramatic spike in phone production since 2011, companies have stopped optimizing and updating software for the entire product range, focusing only on their flagship models. This leads to the abandonment of parallel devices of the main models and all those low-mid range phones. The life of the products was drastically reduced - if you could not afford a flagship phone the device could be considered obsolete at the moment of purchase. This new attitude causes an increase in planned obsolescence, creating artificial demand generation. To prevent abandonware, that is software that ceases to be supported by manufacturers, the community of consumers and enthusiasts started taking action themselves. According to the International Data Corporation Android smartphones held 59% of the market in the first quarter of 2012. <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToast('note_1_3', true, 'c1')"> 3 </sup> The wide diffusion and the open source nature of Google’s OS facilitate hacking practices and flourishing of communities that start to develop independent software. It’s in this context of smartphones with short life cycles, old or at best poorly optimized software that the story of modding begins. This movement is a practical response by developers and users to the rush for high-end hardware imposed by manufacturers.</p>

        An ecosystem, in biology, describes all the organisms, the physical environment in which they live, and defines all of the complex interactions and mutual dependencies. The balance that is created allows the system to function. For software, the concept is much the same <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToast('note_1_4', true, 'c1')"> 4 </sup> : services, delivered in the form of applications, interact and respond to each other within an environment that provides this connection. Within our smartphones we have different services that communicate among themselves, optimizing mutually. The interconnection is the value that keeps us within a system. We choose our preferred ecosystems precisely based on their ability to cover not only every area of work but also leisure. We can argue that now almost all the systems on our phones are ecosystems, and that is true, but on which features do these systems change? One aspect we can consider is the openness of the system. By openness we can consider how much the environment is user-customizable or how prone it is to receive influences from third-party components. Openness for a technological ecosystem also means how much developers can get their hands on it and have access to the mechanics of operation. In the case of Android, after certainly being considered one of the systems where the user has the most room for action, it also has an open source core: this means that much of its code is made available by the parent company. But as the tech journalist JR Raphael <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToast('note_1_5', true, 'c1')"> 5 </sup> states, the open nature of Android does not only apply to the user, who is free to customize his or her device as he or she wishes, but it also applies to manufacturers and phone companies, which sometimes block the freedom of the system in advance.</p>

      <p class="col_m">The Android ecosystem is really fragmented and it differs from brand to brand, from device to device. Unlike other systems that run on a few phones, Android is spread across a large scale of devices, and an optimization process is needed. Taking in account the most common distribution and use of Android, the system as a user perspective can be divided in three layers:<br>
        <br>– The Android Open Source Project (AOSP)
        <br>– The Google Mobile Services (GMS)
        <br>– The custom interfaces by the manufacturers

    <div><p class="col_s"></p>
      <p class="col_m">The Android operating system is based mainly on a modified version of the Linux Kernel. The core of the system is AOSP (Android Open Source Project), a free and open source software released under the Apache License. The source code is maintained by Google, which updates and releases the code every time a new version of Android is released. Even if the core code of the OS is public, the AOSP code doesn’t contain the device’s drivers; it’s up to the manufacturers to make them available or not. Over the past decade, Google has made several decisions that have made Android a system increasingly dependent on Google services. Without the Google app store for example, you won’t have access to all the apps on the market. There are devices, such as educational tablets for kids or car tablets, which don’t need to be dependent on Google services. They are just using the AOSP code to run a basic version of Android. If this can be valid for specific products, for most of the smartphones having access to Google Mobile Services is fundamental to be part of the Android market. The GMS (Google Mobile Services) is composed of a set of apps (like Gmail, Maps, Play Store…) and APIs (application programming interfaces) that allows the user to have access to all the Google ecosystem on your device. This package is usually already installed on most of the devices: a report shows how over 70% of smartphones come in the market out of the box with the GMS package. <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToast('note_1_6', true, 'c1')"> 6 </sup> In order to pre-install the Google services to their devices, manufacturers need to buy a license from Google, which is free around the world, except for the EU. <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToast('note_1_7', true, 'c1')"> 7 </sup> A big problem of Android is the software fragmentation: since the system has to run on such a wide range of hardware, delays on updates and security patches are common. Google tried to fix the problem by updating some of the system apps through the Play Store, independently from regular OS updates. In 2012 they announced the Play Services, which is a proprietary software package that runs in the background, maintaining updated Google libraries and services on your phone. These libraries include sign-on, location and security protocols, as cloud infrastructures for gaming, printing and payment. Play Services was advertised as a way for developers to combat fragmentation by helping them distribute the code once to every device. Ron Amadeo, a reviewer and tech writer specializes in Android OS and Google products, wrote on Ars Technica (2013) <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToast('note_1_8', true, 'c1')"> 8 </sup>:<br><br>

      <span style="margin-left: 10%; display: block">Calling Play Services an "app" doesn't really tell the whole story. For starters, it has an insane amount of permissions. It's basically a system-level process, and if the above list isn't enough for whatever it needs to do next, it can actually give itself more permissions without the user's consent. Play Services constantly runs in the background of every Android phone, and nearly every Google app relies on it to function. It's updatable, but it doesn't update through the Play Store like every other app. It has its own silent, automatic update mechanism that the user has no control over. In fact, most of the time the user never even knows an update has happened. The reason for the complete and absolute power this app has is simple: Google Play Services is Google's new platform.</span><br><br>

      In this way, Google is privatizing several system mechanics, making them closed-source. What is left to the Android core if we remove most of the functionalities? Can we continue calling it an open system? This change caused a lot of issues for modders who developed custom ROMs without including Google services: a lot of apps that used Play Services (so not only the Google’s ones) could no longer run on just AOSP based Android distributions.

      <p class="col_m">In 2012 FairSearch, a lobbying group of organizations that include Microsoft, Oracle and Nokia, sent a complaint to the European Commission to expose the monopoly of Google. They state that Google forces manufacturers to use its services, orienting Android to a more proprietary system. This is not only regarding the influence on Android but also the privileged position as a search engine. Between 2018 and 2019 Google has been accused of abuse of Android dominance by the Competition Commission of India and the EU antitrust, leading them to reformulate the services license agreement by separating it from the Android OS license. When Google understood the big role which the OS could play in the smartphone industry, they reverted these changes and closed the Android ecosystem. Richard Stallman, free software movement activist, has been very critical of this approach, arguing that this closed-source drift of Android may totally subvert the operating system from its initial purposes. <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToast('note_1_9', true, 'c1')"> 9 </sup> The company states that these decisions are made also for security reasons but many independent developers, connected to the open source communities, claimed that in an environment where code is open to access, it’s easier to fix system flaws. The Mountain View company is forcing OEMs and developers to buy its license to have a complete experience of the OS, slowly turning Android into a <a class="hand_glossary" onmouseover="openToast('glossary_freemium', false, 'c1')" onmouseleave="closeToast()">freemium</a> service. Also, some native applications that at the beginning were part of the AOSP, gradually have been substituted into proprietary apps. Search, music, messaging, camera, calendar and other services have migrated to the Google-branded version. They changed their concept of Android: the goal it’s not anymore to build an open-source mobile operating system but just provide a structure to add Google services.</p>

        Since 2020 the development of the hardware is slowing down since we reached a saturation of some features like the display density or the amount of RAM. The politics of computational luxury can no longer be perpetrated by manufacturers. Concerning the software, modding is not as popular as before because most of the brands try to keep their system closed blocking self customization practices. <a class="hand_glossary" onmouseover="openToast('glossary_oem', false, 'c3')" onmouseleave="closeToast()">OEMs</a> are trying to regain control over the market by making decisions in the software sector. For example in 2021 Samsung made the camera inefficient in the Galaxy Z Fold3 for the users who unlocked the bootloader. <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToast('note_3_1', true, 'c3')"> 1 </sup> On the other hand there are still a lot of Android users who use custom ROMs and mods. The Samsung Galaxy S III and Note II are still updated after ten years after being introduced. <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToast('note_3_2', true, 'c3')"> 2 </sup> Modding survives still today for several reasons: one of them is to keep the software in older models updated, with the goal of counteracting the short life of the devices. Moreover, there are several fork experiments that aim to improve OS security and privacy, such as CalyxOS, CopperheadOS, and GrapheneOS (all three born in 2022). Many users install modules or custom ROMs to customize their devices and adapt them to their own needs more than manufacturers do for them. In this sense, the practice of explorative playfulness still lives on forcefully. The market based on computational luxury has generated a great lack on the software side. The increase in computing power has made it less necessary to optimize apps. The hardware race competed by different manufacturers has left much room for modding to provide software support. Android's biggest problem remains fragmentation and scarce software optimization. The Play Store is full of apps that are similar to each other and poorly developed. The ability to install third-party apps from the store, which was one of the key aspects of smartphones, faded into the background in this first smartphone era. Consumers today rely on one brand over another for the suite of apps and features that manufacturers offer. In this sense, we are almost back to the pre-smartphone era. The large assortment of possibilities that these systems preached has been reduced to the fifty most popular third-party apps.</p>

        With the design project I intend to reflect on the practice of modding through an online workshop. The object of investigation is the interface, which is the medium that contains all the contradictions between the closed, market-driven software and the open, experimental, and independent one. The workshop takes into account a collective brainstorming phase to focus on users' ideals and needs. With an approach of explorative playfulness, not unlike the modders, we will try to translate participants' concepts into features to be implemented in the interface. Introductory tutorials/lectures will be posted in the community communication channel to introduce this activity: these are intended to give historical/conceptual context to a purely technical practice. The language used in the videos originates from YouTube tutorials. It's characterized by a mix of techniques ranging from direct shooting, device screen recording, and the use of diagrams which are commented on by the host. The purpose is to create a sharing space in which to introduce theoretical reflection into a purely technical domain. At the same time, it is a discussion about the practice of modding as a collective activity. Starting with technical problem solving, it creates new imagery, though interfaces, that makes users more aware of their tools. </p>
