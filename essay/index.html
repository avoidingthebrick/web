        <p class="col_m">It was 2011 when I got my first smartphone. A Samsung Galaxy S: the first model of a successful series of smartphones, still among the most popular today. I remember the fascination that a 14-year-old guy who was passionate about technology could have in front of that object. It felt like a miniature computer with unlimited potential. In less than a year I was hooked on the Android world, trying to figure out how to make the most of such a tool. After some months since I bought the phone, Google released a new version of Android: 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. Needless to say, I couldn't wait to get the update from the company so I could try all the new features and graphical innovations. I soon discovered that my model was a variant of the more famous flagship model, called Samsung Galaxy S SCL. This device differed by a few components from its main model, such as type of screen, GPU, and memory. However, this was enough to make it not compatible with the updates that the flagship model received. Digging into Android tech-enthusiast forums I discovered that some independent developers created unofficial updates of Android for my phone: that was my first contact with modding communities. From that time I started to mod my device by downloading and installing (or <a class="hand_glossary" onmouseover="openToast('glossary_flashing', false, 'c0')" onmouseleave="closeToast()">flashing</a> to use a tech slang term) unofficial firmwares, skins and mods, together with a friend of mine with the same phone model as me. The period between 2010 and 2018 was really prolific for developers and users: the influence this community has on the smartphone market it’s tangible.</p>

        <p class="col_m">Parallel to that path, as an enthusiast, I felt the need to communicate to others the existence of this underworld, mostly the prerogative of Android nerds. I wanted to enter this community as an active member. So, after some experiments made the year before, in July 2013 my friend Davide and I opened a YouTube channel dedicated to Android modding. The goal was to raise awareness of the culture of modding in Italy, where at the time it was still not widespread. From 2012 to 2016 we made informative videos about the smartphone market, reviews and tutorials about modding. We got in touch with different developers, met and supported small independent projects that were trying to come up with an open and user-understandable idea of technology. One aspect that I became aware of only later is the political power of this community: modding is not just about solving technical issues but is a collective effort to elaborate an idea of technology that they intend to apply to society. Users and enthusiasts come together spontaneously to react to market trends that they see as not in line with their own thinking. The subversion of production systems into collective bottom-up logic makes modding a practice of activism. This opens up discussions about the role of the user within the phone market. If we frame these debates as a public discussion, what are the user's rights?</p>

        <p class="col_m">This paper stems from the need to frame Android modding within a broader movement of hacking practices and technological activism. Since there are not any books or bibliographic resources specifically about Android modding the information I retrieved are taken mainly from forum threads, YouTube videos and articles in tech magazines. The reconstruction of the birth and development of this subcommunity is mediated by what has been my approach and experience as a user and disseminator. I, therefore, invite people to see this text as an attempt at a partial reconstruction of a complex movement that includes tens of thousands of developers and as many threads on forums and videos.</p>

        According to the Cambridge dictionary, luxury is “something expensive that is pleasant to have but is not necessary” <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToast('note_1_1', true, 'c1')"> 1 </sup>. Luxury is a driving market because for many people it represents one of the keys to positioning themselves in a higher social class. In many areas, luxury manifests itself as experiential luxury or related to the design of goods. In technology, luxury is visible (also) as an overabundance of computing power and is conveyed through data and lists of specs. In this chapter, I intend to explore the concept of computational luxury understood as a feature that marked the early development of the smartphone market. In the decade 2007-2017, we witnessed a technological boost that conditioned the social, environmental and technological impact of this sector. The phone market was driven by a surplus of computing power that monopolized the debate. Communication has also been shaped around selling data, numbers, and the technical features of devices, fueling consumerist logic. But in order to grasp this logic, we must understand the cultural shift in the software and hardware we operate - from advanced office stationery in the 90s to a personal accessory of the second half of the 2000s. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, mobile devices were seen as business tools, which aimed to digitize some office functions (agenda, mail, calendar). PDAs (personal digital assistants) were an attempt to miniaturize computers, becoming the first mobile products to include personal information manager tools. The concept of these products is similar to the early computer user interfaces, which took full force from the imagery of the office to create a digital parallel to it. The metaphor of the desk with files, folders, and recycle bin is carried over into the mobile world. It takes a business-oriented direction, becoming a status symbol among American managers.</p>

      <p class="col_m">On January 9, 2007, the first step of a big revolution happened: Steve Jobs presented the first iPhone at the MacWorld conference in San Francisco. With this announcement Apple changed the paradigm of these devices forever. Already previously with products such as Nokia 9210 Communicator (2001) or the world of Pocket PCs there was an attempt to expand this market in this direction. However, it’s only after Apple's conference that smartphones are consolidated in our daily lives. These objects from substitutes for business physical objects (calculator, notebook, landline phone) become our photo and music archives as well as leisure and entertainment devices. The way smartphones are sold also changed: we moved from a business-oriented type of communication to a more intimate and familiar one. Ties and desks are gone from ads and we started to see parents, children, living rooms, kitchens and everyday situations. But how to stand out in this new technological environment where products become more than just the sum of their operations and where the immediate utility of technology is obscured?</p>

      <p class="col_m">In the second decade of the 2000s, smartphone manufacturers spent their energies on miniaturizing smartphone components with the goal of making them more and more performing. From now on, the computational luxury begins. Each year the challenge is to be able to produce a device that outperforms both the competitors and their own model from the previous year. The advertising language is enriched with technical terminologies such as PPI, NIT for displays; mAh and Watt for battery life and charging speed; MegaPixel for cameras and GHz for processors. This approach has bent the market to the continuous search for data that can be sold to the public, incentivizing the consumerist aspect. This trend leads to an obsession with the practice of benchmarking. The goal is to stress test the device in order to retrieve a score that can be used to compare different phones. While reviews and hands-on spread across the web, versus.com becomes more and more popular. This website allows you to compare the technical specifications of different smartphones. Tools like this contribute to shaping the debate in a purely technical realm. We can imagine that this tech direction is also a consequence of homogenization in terms of design: if the device cannot stand out aesthetically, it must do so through its technical capabilities. Since the variety of shapes, screen types, and colors has become obsolete, branding strategies had to adapt.</p>

        <p class="col_m">In this period, manufacturers decide to release more and more phones into the market than the usual annual unveilings: hence, an overabundance of devices is created. Consumers had to face this clutter, being induced to consider the computational aspect as crucial, no longer finding answers in product design. Also nomenclatures become more complex: we can notice the wide use of terms like mini, plus, pro and ultra, which confuse the consumer. These categories, based on supposedly objective technical capabilities rather than aesthetic qualities, created a clear hierarchy. Slide-out keyboards, rotating cameras, and satin finishes are no longer criteria for producing and categorizing phones. The new policy of manufacturers is to produce the flagship model with the highest performance possible and saturate the market in the mid-range by distributing mini, ultra or max variants. Companies, after the dramatic spike in phone production since 2011, have stopped optimizing and updating software for the entire product range, focusing only on flagship models. This leads to the abandonment of parallel devices of the main models and all those low-mid range phones. The design life of the products was drastically reduced - if you could not afford a flagship phone the device could be considered obsolete at the moment of purchase. This new attitude causes an increase in two phenomena: planned obsolescence and artificial demand generation. To prevent abandonware, that is software that ceases to have support from manufacturers, the community of consumers and enthusiasts take action themselves. According to the IDC Android smartphones held 59% of the market in the first quarter of 2012 <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToast('note_1_2', true, 'c1')"> 2 </sup>. The wide diffusion and the open source nature of Google’s OS facilitate hacking practices and flourishing of communities that start to develop independent software. It’s in this context of smartphones with short life cycles, old or at best poorly optimized software that the story of modding begins. This movement is a practical response by developers and users to the rush for high-end hardware imposed by manufacturers.</p>
